Without knowledge of the password for an account, an adversary may opt to systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism. An adversary may guess login credentials without prior knowledge of system or environment passwords during an operation by using a list of common passwords. Password guessing may or may not take into account the target's policies on password complexity or use policies that may lock accounts out after a number of failed attempts. Guessing passwords can be a risky option because it could cause numerous authentication failures and account lockouts, depending on the organization's login failure policies. (Citation: Cylance Cleaver) Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when guessing passwords. Commonly targeted services include the following: * SSH (22\/TCP) * Telnet (23\/TCP) * FTP (21\/TCP) * NetBIOS \/ SMB \/ Samba (139\/TCP &amp; 445\/TCP) * LDAP (389\/TCP) * Kerberos (88\/TCP) * RDP \/ Terminal Services (3389\/TCP) * HTTP\/HTTP Management Services (80\/TCP &amp; 443\/TCP) * MSSQL (1433\/TCP) * Oracle (1521\/TCP) * MySQL (3306\/TCP) * VNC (5900\/TCP) * SNMP (161\/UDP and 162\/TCP\/UDP) In addition to management services, adversaries may \"target single sign-on (SSO) and cloud-based applications utilizing federated authentication protocols,\" as well as externally facing email applications, such as Office 365.(Citation: US-CERT TA18-068A 2018). Further, adversaries may abuse network device interfaces (such as `wlanAPI`) to brute force accessible wifi-router(s) via wireless authentication protocols.(Citation: Trend Micro Emotet 2020) In default environments, LDAP and Kerberos connection attempts are less likely to trigger events over SMB, which creates Windows \"logon failure\" event ID 4625.<\/p>",

(Citation: Cylance Cleaver) Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when guessing passwords. Commonly targeted services include the following: * SSH (22\/TCP) * Telnet (23\/TCP) * FTP (21\/TCP) * NetBIOS \/ SMB \/ Samba (139\/TCP &amp; 445\/TCP) * LDAP (389\/TCP) * Kerberos (88\/TCP) * RDP \/ Terminal Services (3389\/TCP) * HTTP\/HTTP Management Services (80\/TCP &amp; 443\/TCP) * MSSQL (1433\/TCP) * Oracle (1521\/TCP) * MySQL (3306\/TCP) * VNC (5900\/TCP) * SNMP (161\/UDP and 162\/TCP\/UDP) In addition to management services, adversaries may \"target single sign-on (SSO) and cloud-based applications utilizing federated authentication protocols,\" as well as externally facing email applications, such as Office 365.(Citation: US-CERT TA18-068A 2018). Further, adversaries may abuse network device interfaces (such as `wlanAPI`) to brute force accessible wifi-router(s) via wireless authentication protocols.(Citation: Trend Micro Emotet 2020) In default environments, LDAP and Kerberos connection attempts are less likely to trigger events over SMB, which creates Windows \"logon failure\" event ID 4625.<\/p>",
